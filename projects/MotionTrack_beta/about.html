			<div  id="about">
				<p>My science research has focused on using microscopy and data analysis to follow the motion
				of individual molecules and microscopic particles in order to learn about dynamic processes
				in nature.  This <b>single-particle approach</b> is in fact quite general and with improvements in sensors
				and computation, there has been effort in many fields to derive insight from the <b>detailed, granular
				view</b> provided by single object data. What I find most interesting are the <b>similarities</b> between motion
				at very different scales.  Maybe there are commonalities in the underlying physics and perhaps
				methods developed in one field could find use in another.</p>
				
				<p>These data come from publicly available repositories as well as my own research.  Details
				and links to the data are provided on individual pages.  In some cases, outliers and data
				artifacts are evident, but without knowing the full details of the data collection and
				processing, I left the data as they were.</p>
				
				<p>The visualizations were made using <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a>.</p>
