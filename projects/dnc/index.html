          <h1>Distance to Nearest Climbing</h1>

          <p>
            <img class="fullcol" src="NearestClimbing_v1.jpg">
          </p>
          <p>Inspired by the "distance to nearest road" <a href="http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20053011">project</a>
          of the USGS, I wanted a map that would show the distance to nearest climbing in the conterminus US.  First
          I needed the geographic coordinates of all climbing locations in the US.  For this, I went to
          <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com">mountainproject.com</a> which maintains a relatively
          complete list of climbing locations, from world class (Yosemite) to the barely known (I-70 East Bound
          Rest Area, Kansas?).  After harvesting the geographic coordinates for each area and learning
          how to handle geographic data in python (<a href="http://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.org">Basemap</a>),
          I came up with verion 1, shown above.</p>
                                          
          <p>What can we learn from a map of the distance to nearest climbing?</p>
          <ul>
                  <li>You're never very far from climbing in the US, but if you are a climber, you might
                  want to avoid Louisiana.</li>
                  <li>Theres's climbing in Florida!</li>
                  <li>There are weaknesses in any type of data analysis.  Here it's that all climbing areas
                  are considered equal, so that being one mile from a mecca like Yosemite is the same as
                  being a mile from a graffitied lump of rock under a highway.  A better map
                  would show a metric that includes both proximity and quantity/quality of climbing, but that
                  will have to wait until version 2 (which is now <a href="../PtC/">here</a>).</li>
          </ul>
